        <Paragraph>I'm a software developer with 10+ years of experience, this site is where I go to try new things
            and refresh my skills. I have used other playground sites, but just find it more enjoyable to have total
            control over every aspect of my development environment.

            I have recently been a casualty of our every changing econmomy and have found myself laid off for the second
            time in 6 months. To keep my skills sharp, I plan on investing a signifigant amount of time adding features
            here. So please, look around and enjoy üòÅ
